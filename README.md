# Gavel SDK

**Evidence-aware prediction markets and intelligent oracles for GenLayer.**

Gavel turns a typed JavaScript specification into a pinned, deployable GenLayer intelligent contract. Validators retrieve approved public evidence independently, reach consensus, and persist the result with its specification hash and evidence digest.

## Install

```bash
npm i @gavel-sdk/core
```

Node.js 22.13 or newer is required.

## Generate an intelligent contract

```ts
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { earthquakeDemoContract } from '@gavel-sdk/core/contracts';

const generated = earthquakeDemoContract();
await writeFile('earthquake_resolver.py', generated.source);
await writeFile('earthquake_resolver.json', JSON.stringify(generated.compiledSpec, null, 2));
```

The generated Python contract pins a concrete GenVM runner, restricts evidence to explicit HTTPS origins, and stores deterministic hashes that clients can verify.

## Build a custom market

```ts
import { generateIntelligentContract } from '@gavel-sdk/core/contracts';

const contract = generateIntelligentContract({
  className: 'GavelElectionResolver',
  spec: {
    marketId: 'CERTIFIED-ELECTION',
    question: 'Did candidate A win the certified election?',
    outcomes: [
      { id: 'YES', index: 0, label: 'Candidate A won' },
      { id: 'NO', index: 1, label: 'Candidate A did not win' },
    ],
    resolutionRules: ['Use the final certified result. Return UNRESOLVED on conflict.'],
    resolutionTime: 1782864000,
    approvedSources: ['https://results.example.gov/final.json'],
    sourcePolicy: { authority: 'Official election authority' },
  },
  shape: { kind: 'BINARY' },
  evidence: {
    sources: [{ url: 'https://results.example.gov/final.json' }],
  },
});
```

## Oracle modes

| Generator | Result | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generateIntelligentContract` | Categorical verdict | Prediction markets, claims, event resolution |
| `generateScalarOracle` | Numeric observation and payout weights | Temperature, rainfall, prices, indexes |
| `generateOddsJournal` | Consensus odds snapshots | Auditable market history and agent signals |

`gavelDeliveryProofContract()` is a reproducible proof recipe that acquires the public SDK README inside the nondeterministic flow and binds validator agreement to its normalized evidence digest and approval decision.

`createOracleClient` reads contract state and defaults to finalized results. API helpers build evidence policies and preview public JSON. Platform modules add lifecycle certificates, validator consensus, evidence graphs, simulation, replay, and contract auditing.

## Deploy with GenLayer CLI

### Verified Studio Next deployment

[Gavel SDK public delivery resolver on Studio Next](https://explorer-studio-dev.genlayer.com/address/0x8aB6Bb90BABd7A37cACb5DC8Ef16E37A3D1d6cC5) is deployed on **chain ID 61997**. Deployment transaction: `0xfd5ce69672a404e99bb8670c1b36f750ed938eec282693dd547797a0d50c2aee`; verified `FINALIZED` with `FINISHED_WITH_RETURN`. Reading `get_progress` returned `{ attempts: 0, maxAttempts: 8, resolved: false }`.

This deployment adds `# v0.2.0` before the generated pinned runner header and supplies both the live fee estimate's `distribution` and `feeValue`. Its deployment is verified; evidence resolution has not been run.

```bash
npm run build
npm run generate:examples
genlayer network set studionet
genlayer deploy --contract artifacts/studionet-samples/usgs_reviewed_2024_resolver.py
genlayer deploy --contract artifacts/studionet-samples/berlin-temperature-20240701_scalaroracle.py
```

Two SDK-generated examples are live on GenLayer StudioNet. Addresses, transaction hashes, and verification commands are in [StudioNet deployments](docs/STUDIONET-DEPLOYMENTS.md).

### Studio Next developer deployment

Prepare a deployment project for Studio Next (chain ID `61997`) from a generated, zero-argument Gavel contract:

```bash
gavel prepare-studio-next earthquake_resolver.py studio-next-deployment
cd studio-next-deployment
npx --yes genlayer@0.40.0-rc.3 network set studio-dev
npx --yes genlayer@0.40.0-rc.3 account list
npx --yes genlayer@0.40.0-rc.3 deploy
```

Select or create your deployment account with GenLayer CLI first. The generated script checks chain 61997, adds the verified `# v0.2.0` header, obtains a live fee estimate, and submits both distribution and fee value. Signing stays in GenLayer CLI. It saves `transaction.json` immediately after submission and resumes that transaction on rerun. Success requires finalization and `FINISHED_WITH_RETURN`; the script prints the Studio Next explorer link and saves `receipt.json`.

The fee allocation is a development preset for these generated contracts, not a measured profile for arbitrary contracts. Review it before signing. Constructor arguments default to empty. Studio Next can reset its state. The stable SDK client continues to use genlayer-js 1.x; Studio Next deployment uses the compatible CLI rather than an incomplete chain definition. `gavel studio-next-info` prints its canonical endpoints.

## Trust model

- Installing the SDK does not deploy a contract or prove an external fact.
- An evidence digest proves which normalized evidence was used; validator consensus determines the accepted result.
- `ACCEPTED` and `FINALIZED` are distinct lifecycle states. Settlement code must wait for successful finalization.
- `UNRESOLVED` is a valid result and must never be treated as a winning outcome.
- The SDK never creates, stores, or exposes wallet private keys.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:contracts
npm pack --dry-run
```
